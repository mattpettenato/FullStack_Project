## Features
#### User Authentication
Users are able to create an account and sign in or sign in as a demo user. Once the review feature is successfully implemented, users will be required to sign in if they want to create a new review for a business. 
#### Business Show Page
The business show page displays information pertaining to a business and includes images, a rating, and a soon user reviews. The google map implmented for every business will soon be able to show a marker for the exact location of every business in the database.

## Future Features
In the near future, I plan on adding a working search bar where users will be able to search keyterms in order to access an index page listing relative businesses. I am also planning on fixing user auth errors and having errors clear, instead of persisting. A big feature I plan on finishing is the ability for users to create a review for a business and have the average of all reviews directly effect the business rating that is displayed.
